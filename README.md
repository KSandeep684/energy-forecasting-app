# energy-forecasting-app

This project is an interactive energy consumption forecasting dashboard built using Streamlit.
It uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) deep learning models to predict future energy usage based on historical AEP hourly data.

The app includes:

 Dataset upload
 Statistical summary
 Visual data exploration
 LSTM model training
 Forecasting next 100 days
 Visualization of actual vs predicted values
 Export predictions as CSV

 Features:-
Dataset Exploration,
Preview dataset,
View descriptive statistics,
Check for missing values.

 Visualizations:-
Year-wise Energy Consumption,
Month-wise Energy Consumption,
Energy Distribution Histogram.

 LSTM Model Training:-
Preprocessing & normalization,
Sequence creation (past 60 days → predict next day),
Deep LSTM neural network,
Automatic training.

 Forecasting:-
Predicts the next 100 days of energy consumption.

Displays:
